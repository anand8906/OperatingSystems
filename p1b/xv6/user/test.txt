The read() function shall attempt to read nbyte bytes from the file associated with the open file descriptor, fildes, into the buffer pointed to by buf. The behavior of multiple concurrent reads on the same pipe, FIFO, or terminal device is unspecified.

Before any action described below is taken, and if nbyte is zero, the read() function may detect and return errors as described below. In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed, the read() function shall return zero and have no other results.

On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the read() shall start at a position in the file given by the file offset associated with fildes. The file offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes actually read.

Files that do not support seeking-for example, terminals-always read from the current position. The value of a file offset associated with such a file is undefined.

No data transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the starting position is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be returned. If the file refers to a device special file, the result of subsequent read() requests is implementation-defined.
