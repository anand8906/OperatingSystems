my-cat : 

used fgets to read into a buffer of 1024 and printf to output on stdout.

my-grep :

using getline to allow for lines of arbitrary length, using string.h to check if the serch word exists in every line.

my-zip :

reading the file as in above examples and then counting continuos row of each character maintaining a prev. if curr character is same as previous character in the stream, then increment the count, else write to stdout using fwrite, integers as sizeof(int) bytes and character as sizeof(character) bytes.

my-unzip :

reading the binary file using fread first for the count of character and next for the actual character and writing the character 'count' times to stdout.
